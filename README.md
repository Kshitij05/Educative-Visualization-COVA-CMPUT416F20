Topic: Creative visualization for the android static analysis tool COVA

Motivation: As a very open-ended framework, android is more vulnerable to taint than most other frameworks, thus making it essential for analysis tools to be used for the betterment of code. Visualizations of such analysis tools are essential to encourage the widespread use of taint program analysis during android application development. Analysis visualizations help understand analysis tools better, which can help benefit teaching, research and development.

Proposal: We would like to create a visualization for the android analysis tool - COVA, in order to be able to understand this tool better, and develop a more efficient and safer code for android applications. The functioning of COVA will be analyzed using the COVA language server for Eclipse IDE, and a brief demonstration of how COVA works will be explained formally. Furthermore, an animated graphical visualization will be created using Articulate Storyline 3 in order to make the functionality of COVA even more clear.
